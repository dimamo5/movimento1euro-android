##Movimento 1 Euro, What is it? 
The [Movimento 1 Euro](https://movimento1euro.com/) is a non-profit organization that aims to help charities. All members contribute with one euro every month to a cause of charity. The organization aims to provide goods to charitable causes. Every month the organization receives applications for various causes that are voted by the members.  Every month, these causes of charity are presented to the users and they vote on the one they think that it deserves to receive goods in the amount accumulated monthly. The cause that collects the largest number of votes is the one that receives the goods and services intended. It is noteworthy that the organization does not give money to the causes, it gives goods and services that are requested in the application. 

##Product vision
With the continued growth of the mobile market, it is necessary to follow the new technologies. The Movimento 1 Euro is entering a new phase, and more than ever it needs to adapt to the needs of its users. With a view to establishing users as loyal, attracting new members, and modernizing services, they will evolve in all areas.
These services are aimed at users who are associated with the Movimento 1 Euro, who need an easier way to access and interact with content, and movement managers who need an easy way to interact with users.
The product includes two applications. A mobile application for ordinary users, it offers most of the features of the site, such as viewing news, causes, voting, among others, in a more accessible way. And a web application for administrators that allows you to send and control various types of notifications to users of the mobile application in a customizable way. Together, they form a unique and integrated service for users who want to continuously contribute to charity. It is a unique idea, idealized in the form of the most modern technologies.
